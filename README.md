Udacity Become React Developer ND


### Project Problem Statement üìú
This App is based on the classic game of flash cards. Flash cards is used by people, generally students, to memorise things. In its physical form, people write question on one side of the card and answer on the other side of the card. Then they shuffle the cards and start the quiz. They read the question and try to answer it. After answering they turn the card to see whether the answer was correct or not and then mark the count of correct/incorrect in a sheet. Finally once all the cards are done, they see how many correct questions they answered.
